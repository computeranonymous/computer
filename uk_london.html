<h2>History</h2>

<p>Once upon a time, there were four London Computer Anonymous groups, the most active of which was <a href="http://why.computer/uk_east_london.html">East London</a>. 
<a href="http://why.computer/uk_west_london.html">West London</a> also met on occasion, but rarely actually in the west.
<a href="http://why.computer/uk_central_london.html">Central London</a> met once, but sadly, <a href="http://why.computer/uk_north_london.html">North London</a> still haven't.</p>

<p>One day, these groups may become active again, but for now, the group formerly known as West London, is holding irregular meet ups, under the guise of Computer Anonymous - London.</a></p>
