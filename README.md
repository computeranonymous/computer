## Computer Anonymous

A meeting for people who don't know what they are doing on computer. The ideals and rules of the meetup are documented in index.html. 

We want to create a social group for people in and around tech, from all backgrounds, where they feel comfortable and welcome. 

We're not an outreach or or an eductational group, although both are important to us, we're primarily a technology related meetup, but with a code of conduct.

If you want to start your own meetup, fork and open a pull request. We also love feedback and translations.

Meeting pages and changes will usually almost always get merged straight away, but other changes take time.

## Writing Guidelines

- We want to be explicit, not implicit, but we want to avoid special cases and lists where possible.
- We want to avoid both slang and jargon, especially in the rules. We want to be conversational, not bureaucratic or formal in tone.
- We have a have a complexity budget, we cannot make an exhaustive set of rules, and we have to translate things so the less words the better.
- Smaller changes to the Rules have a higher chance of success, larger changes take more discussion. Edit one line at a time.
- The Code of Conduct is not a solution to people's behavior, but it is about admitting there is a problem. 
- Please avoid gendered language. This means don't use "guys", "guys and gals", "dude". We suggest "meatbags", "people", "peeps" or "folks".
