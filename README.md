## Computer Anonymous

A meeting for people who don't know what they are doing on Computer Anonymous. The ideals and rules of the meetup are documented in index.html. 

We want to create a social group for people around the tech industry where they feel comfortable and welcome. 

We are primarily a technology related meetup with a code of conduct, and not an outreach or eductational group.

If you want to start your own meetup, fork and open a pull request. Any feedback or translations are appreciated.

Meeting pages and changes will usually merge immediately; other changes will take longer.

## Writing Guidelines

- We want to be explicit, but we want to avoid special cases and lists where possible.
- We want to avoid slang and jargon, especially in the rules. We want to be conversational, not bureaucratic or formal in tone.
- Having a complexity budget means an exhaustive set of rules is impossible.
- Having less words to translate is better.
- Smaller changes to the Rules have a higher chance of success, larger changes take more discussion. Edit one line at a time.
- The Code of Conduct is not a solution to people's behavior, but it is about admitting there is a problem. 
- Please avoid gendered language. This means don't use "guys", "guys and gals", "dude". We suggest "meatbags", "people", "peeps" or "folks".
