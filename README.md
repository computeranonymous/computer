## Computer Anonymous

A meeting for people who don't know what they are doing on computer. The ideals and rules of the meetup are documented in index.html. 

If you want to start your own meetup, fork and open a pull request. We also love feedback and translations.

We're trying to keep the meeting description and code of conduct to a manageable size. Although it is good to be explicit, we don't want to drown it in technicalities.
