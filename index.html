      <h1>Computer.</h1>

      <h2>Computer ?</h2>

      <h3>Computer :-(</h3>

      <p>Now you understand. Let’s go to computer anonymous.</p>

      <p><a href="#groups">See if there’s one already where you live</a> at the bottom of the page, or start one by <a href="https://github.com/computeranonymous/computer">forking the repository</a>, making your changes, and submitting a pull request.</p>

      <h4>The Plan</h4>

      <ul>
        <li>We go to a good pub or venue.</li>
        <li>We eat food, we drink (be it beer, cocktails or soft drinks).</li>
        <li>We say ‘computer’.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>This might be the group for you if you want to meet socially conscious nerds to talk about interesting things. This is not an entrepreneurial meetup, nor is it networking: It is a support group, a place to meet good people and talk about good and bad things.</p>

      <p>Although education and outreach are both important to us, the primary goal is to create a social group for people in and around tech, from all backgrounds, where they feel comfortable and welcome.</p>

      <p>There aren’t regularly organized talks, workshops, or otherwise. We don’t have tickets, we don’t have namebadges. We’re striving to be as disorganised and informal as possible. We will talk computer a lot but we’d also like to not talk computer too. At the end of the day we’re just wanting not to be alone when we find ourselves saying "computer".</p>

      <h4>Imposters Welcome</h4>

      <p>If you’re from a background which isn’t well-represented in most geeky meetups, come along – we want to make a difference.</p>
      <p>If you’re from a background which is well-represented in most geeky meetups, come along – we want your help making a difference.</p>
      <p>If you’re worried about not being computer enough, come.</p>
      <p>If you think you’re an imposter, come.</p>
      <p>If your day job isn’t code, come.</p>
      <p>This isn’t a group of experts, just people.</p>
      <p>We are interested in the social and technical problems.</p>
      <p>This is a support group. No-one knows what they are doing.</p>

      <h4 id="rules">The Rules</h4>

      <p>
        A code of conduct applies wherever we gather to talk computer. This is true both in person and online.
      </p>

      <ul class="rules">
        <li>We want to be inclusive; do not engage in homophobic, racist, transphobic, ableist, sexist, or otherwise exclusionary behavior. Don’t make exclusionary jokes. Don’t even make them "ironically".</li>
        <li>Don’t harass people. Unconsented physical contact or sexual attention is harrassment. Dressing or acting in a certain way is not consent.</li>
        <li>Aggression and elitism are unwelcome here — computering is not a competition.</li>
        <li>Although we’re meeting in a pub, there is no expectation or pressure to drink alcohol. Don’t question anyone’s choice of drink.</li>
        <li>We’d rather you ask about gender than assume, and if you get it wrong, apologise, and use what they prefer.</li>
        <li>We think feminism is a good thing. Discussion of how to make computer more inclusive is welcome. Claims that this "has gone too far" aren’t.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>It might be a good idea to read about <a href="http://theangryblackwoman.com/2009/10/01/the-dos-and-donts-of-being-a-good-ally/" >being a good ally</a> or some <a href="http://superopinionated.com/101-a-tron/" >specific resources for various issues</a> if you’re worried about offending people.</p>
