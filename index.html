computer.

computer ?

computer :-(

now you understand, let's go to computer anonymous.

the plan
--------

- we all move to berlin
- we eat food
- we go to a good pub
- we say 'computer'
- we drink

there isn't going to be organized talks, workshops, or otherwise. it's just a chance to meet good people and talk about good and bad things. we will talk computer a lot, but we'd also like to not talk computer too. 

we might have a talk, we might try and learn a thing, but at the end of the day we're just here not to be alone when we find ourselves saying "computer".

the rules
---------

- <a href="http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Conference_anti-harassment/Policy">a standard code of conduct applies</a> 
- if you enjoy hacker news, the works of ayn rand, or think feminism 'has gone too far' please note we may be hostile and/or throw rocks. 
- this is not an enterprenuerial meetup, nor is it networking. it is a support group.
- we're a very informal and ad-hoc group right now, so if you piss us off you won't be invited again. 
- the rules will become more explicit if we grow.

the people
----------

@ntlk
@didlix
@tef
@tomstuart
@drmaciver
@samphippen
@mistertim
@alsothings

if you want to be invited, say hello to someone, and they will drag you along. 

the effort
----------

We are making plans on <a href="https://github.com/tef/computer">https://github.com/tef/computer</a> 
(Ask @tef to add you as a contributor)
