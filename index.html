      <h1>Computer.</h1>

      <h2>Computer ?</h2>

      <h3>Computer :-(</h3>

      <p>Now you understand. Let's go to computer anonymous.</p>

      <p><a href="#groups">See if there's one already where you live</a> at the bottom of the page, or start one by <a href="https://github.com/computeranonymous/computer">forking the repository</a>, making your changes, and submitting a pull request.</p>

      <h4>The Plan</h4>

      <p>This might be the group for you if you want to meet socially conscious nerds to talk about interesting things. This is not an entrepeneurial meetup, nor is it networking: It is a support group.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>We go to a good pub or venue.</li>
        <li>We eat food.</li>
        <li>We say 'computer'.</li>
        <li>We drink, be it beer, cocktails or soft drinks.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>There aren't regularly organized talks, workshops, or otherwise.</p>

      <p>It's just a chance to meet good people and talk about good and bad things.</p>

      <p>We will talk computer a lot  but we'd also like to not talk computer too.</p>

      <p>We might have a talk, we might try and learn a thing, but at the end of the day we're just here not to be alone when we find ourselves saying "computer".</p>

      <h4>Imposters Welcome</h4>

      <p>This is a support group. No-one knows what they are doing.</p>
      <p>If you're worried about not being computer enough, come along.</p>
      <p>If you're from a background which isn't well-represented in most geeky meetups, come along – we want to make a difference.</p>
      <p>If your day job isn't code, come along.</p>
      <p>If you think you're an imposter, come along.</p>
      <p>This isn't a group of experts, just people.</p>
      <p>We are interested in the social and technical problems.</p>


      <h4>The Rules</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Don't harass people. Don't make exclusionary jokes. Don't even make them "ironically".</li>
        <li>Discriminatory behaviour (such as homophobia, racism, transphobia, or sexism) is not appropriate.</li>
        <li>We think feminism is a good thing; if you disagree, this probably isn't the place for you.</li>
        <li>Although we're meeting in a pub, there's no expectation or pressure to drink alcohol. Don't question anyone's choice of drink.</li>
      </ul>

        <p>If you piss us off by breaking these rules, you won't be invited again.
            These rules may become more explicit as we grow – we're always trying to change for the better.</p>
