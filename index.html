      <h1>Computer.</h1>

      <h2>Computer ?</h2>

      <h3>Computer :-(</h3>

      <p>Now you understand, let's go to computer anonymous.</p>

      <p>(We only have one group in East London at the moment. Sorry)</p>

      <h4>The Plan</h4>

      <p>This might be the group for you if you want to meet socially conscious nerds, to talk about interesting things: This is not an enterprenuerial meetup, nor is it networking. It is a support group.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>- We eat food</li>
        <li>- We go to a good pub.</li>
        <li>- We say 'computer'</li>
        <li>- We drink, be it beer, cocktails or soft drinks.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>There isn't going to be regularly organized talks, workshops, or otherwise.</p>

      <p>It's just a chance to meet good people and talk about good and bad things.</p>

      <p>We will talk computer a lot, but we'd also like to not talk computer too.</p>

      <p>We might have a talk, we might try and learn a thing, but at the end of the day we're just here not to be alone when we find ourselves saying "computer".</p>

      <h4>Imposters Welcome</h4>

      <p>This is a support group. No-one knows what they are doing.</p>

      <p>If you're worried about not being computer enough, come.</p>

      <p>If your day job isn't code, come.</p>

      <p>If you think you're an imposter, come.</p>

      <p>This isn't a group of experts, just people.</p>

      <p>We are interested in the social and technical problems.</p>


      <h4>The Rules</h4>

      <p><a href="http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Conference_anti-harassment/Policy">A standard code of conduct applies</a>. This means: Don't harass people. Don't make exclusionary jokes. Don't even make them "ironically".</p>

      <ul>
        <li>- We want to be inclusive, but we don't welcome homophobic, racist, transphobic, or sexist behavior, amongst others.</li>
        <li>- We think feminism is a good thing. We think brogramming is a bad thing.</li>
        <li>- We're a very informal and ad-hoc group right now, so if you piss us off you won't be invited again.</li>
        <li>- Although we're meeting in a pub, there is no expectation or pressure to drink alcohol.</li>
        <li>- The rules will become more explicit as we grow, and we're always trying to change for the better.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>The People</h4>

      <p>On IRC: irc.freenode.net <a href="irc://irc.freenode.net/##computer">##computer</a></p>

      <p><a href="http://twitter.com/WhyComputer">@WhyComputer</a> on twitter</p>

      <p>If you want to attend, say hello to someone, and they will drag you along.</p>

      <h4>The Groups</h4>

      <p>We have one group in <a href="uk_london.html">East London</a>, and we're working out the first date.</p>

      <p>If you'd like to start a group nearer you, fork the GitHub repo and send us a pull request.</p>
