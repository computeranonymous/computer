<h3>Computer Oxford! :-D</h3>

<p>
    Now you understand. Let's go to computer oxford.
</p>

<p>
    You can read the overview of <strong>computer</strong> and the <strong>rules</strong> <a href="http://computer.twentygototen.org/">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
    We're going to be quite flexible with the <strong>Computer</strong> meetup in Oxford and not stick to "every <strong>nth</strong> Monday at <strong>location</strong>."
</p>
<p>
    The first Computer Oxford took place on <strong>7th October 2013</strong> and it went well, with 12 people attending. We'll be thinking about the next Computer Oxford shortly.
