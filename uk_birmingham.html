<h1>Computer.</h1>

<h2>Computer ?</h2>

<h3>Computer Birmingham? :-o</h3>

<p>
  Now you understand. Let's go to computer Birmingham
</p>

<p>
  You can read the overview of <strong>computer</strong> and the <strong>rules</strong> <a href="http://why.computer/">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
  We're going to be quite flexible with the <strong>Computer</strong> meetup in Birmingham and see how it fits in with upcoming events for the next month with an aim to get our first one some time in November 2014.
</p>

<p>
  We're currently trying to figure out what to do for the first meetup, but most likely it will be somewhere in Central Birmingham (possibly Urban or Yorks) and we will rotate locations to restaurants and bars if people wish.
</p>

<p>
  If you have any suggestions, try getting in touch with <a href="http://twitter.com/omarqureshi">@omarqureshi</a> and they'll try and do their best to sort you out.
</p>

<p>
  We don't have an IRC channel dedicated to computer yet, but, you can find quite a lot of us on <a href="http://talk.birmingham.io">Birmingham.io</a> or talk to some of us in <a href="irc://irc.freenode.net/%23wmrug">#wmrug</a>.
