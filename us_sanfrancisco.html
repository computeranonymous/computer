      <h2>The Meetings</h2>

      <h3>Next meeting</h3>

      <p>After an enjoyable first meetup at The Sycamore on Sat 5th, and a bit of discussion in irc/meatspace/twitter, it seems like we should alternate between Saturdays and Wednesdays, maybe with some space between.  Let's get a calendar soon (volunteers?)</p>

      <p>Given that The Sycamore went well last time, let's try The Willows for a similar place with slightly more space and similar food fare.</p>

      <p>Time: <strong>Wednesday, Oct 16, 2013 at 7pm PST</strong></p>
      <p>Location: <a href="http://www.thewillowssf.com/">The Willows</a>, 1582 Folsom Street (at 12th)</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Operated by the same people as the Sycamore</li>
        <li>Tasty food (superset of Sycamore's menu)</li>
        <li>Reasonable prices</li>
        <li>Full bar</li>
        <li>Lots of space</li>
        <li>Pool table and pinball machines</li>
        <li>Deep SOMA/almost-inner-Mission</li>
      </ul>

      <p>We've just gotten started! Join us on IRC if you want in. :)</p>
