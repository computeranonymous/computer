<h2>The Meetings</h2>

<p>The organisers are looking to create a non-drinking relaxed North London event as an alternative to the typical "meet in a pub, don't drink if you don't want to" event. We recommend people bring craft projects, instruments, or anything else people might enjoy.</p>

<p><em>This is an experiment.</em></p>

<p>Presently looking for meditation spaces to host a North London meetup. An ideal venue will have:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Lots of Space</li>
  <li>Near two stations</li>
  <li>Geek friendly</li>
  <li>Comfortable seating</li>
  <li>Serves Tea</li>
  <li>Wheelchair friendly</li>
</ul>
