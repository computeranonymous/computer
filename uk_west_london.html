title: Computer Anonymous - West London

<h1>Computer Anonymous â€” West London group</h1>

<p>Read <a href="index.html">The overview</a> if you haven't already, especially the code of conduct.</p>
<p>The oddly named West London group are going to meet at: <a href="http://www.madhatterhotel.co.uk">The Mad Hatter</a>, 
3-7 Stamford Street, London, SE1 9NY, on <b>Thursday 24th October 2013</b>, from about 18:30. 
</p>
<p>Future meet ups will actually be in the west, as opposed to central London, with the next potentially in Richmond, but this meet up is more to get an idea of where people might like to meet in future and to meet people initially. We can argue about whether Balham is an appealing place to meet, or perhaps Neasden? (Unfortunately meeting in the Neasden bunker probably isn't an option.)</p>
<p>All are welcome at this meet up!</p>
