<h1>Starting a Group</h1>

<p>Starting local groups is excellent and highly encouraged, but in order to maintain the integrity of the groups, there are a few things you should keep in mind.</p>

<ul>
<li>
  <strong>Location matters!</strong>
  <ol>
    <li>Venues should be chosen with accessibility in mind - be it
    physical accessibility, financial accessibility, or generally safe
    places for all people.</li>
    <li>Many groups will likely be meeting in pubs and bars, but this
    certainly isn't mandatory and might not even be desired. It's worth
    exploring alternatives.</li>
  </ol>
</li>
<li>
  <strong>Consult the group about best times</strong>
  <ol>
    <li>Finding a good time for <em>everyone</em> is difficult, if not
    impossible, but you should make an attempt to use tools like
    <a href="http://doodle.com/">doodle</a> to find times that work
    best.</li>
  </ol>
</li>
<li>
  <strong>Be mindful of tool barriers</strong>
  <ol>
    <li>Git and IRC are great tools for collaboration, but not everyone
    is familiar with them. We want to include and encourage
    participation from people with all backgrounds, so knowledge of
    these systems shouldn't be a prerequisite.</li>
    <li>Be available in other mediums so people can get help if they
    need it.</li>
  </ol>
</li>
<li>
  <strong>Address problems when they arise</strong>
  <ol>
    <li>Remember, everyones safety is a top priority. In order for these groups to survive, people
      need to be held accountable. Someone should be available to
      handle problems within the group.</li>
  </ol>
</li>
</ul>
