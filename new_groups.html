      <h1>Starting a Group</h1>

      <p>Starting local groups is excellent and highly encouraged, but in order
      to maintain the integrity of the groups, there are a few things you
      should keep in mind.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Location matters!</strong></li>
          <ol>
            <li>Venues should be chosen with accessibility in mind - be it
            physical accessibility, financial accessibility, or generally safe
            places for all people.</li>
            <li>Many groups will likely be meeting in pubs and bars, but this
            certainly isn't mandatory and might not even be desired. It's worth
            exploring alternatives.</li>
          </ol>
        <li><strong>Consult the group about best times</strong></li>
          <ol>
            <li>Finding a good time for <em>everyone</em> is difficult, if not
            impossible, but you should make an attempt to use tools like
            <a href="http://doodle.com/">doodle</a> to find times that work
            best.</li>
          </ol>
        <li><strong>Be mindful of tool barriers</strong></li>
          <ol>
            <li>Git and IRC are great tools for collaboration, but not everyone
            is familiar with them. We want to include and encourage
            participation from people with all backgrounds, so knowledge of
            these systems shouldn't be a prerequisite.</li>
            <li>Be available in other mediums so people can get help if they
            need it.</li>
          </ol>
          <li><strong>Address problems when they arise</strong></li>
            <ol>
              <li>In order for these groups to survive as safe places people
              need to be held accountable. Someone should be available to
              handle problems within the group.</li>
            </ol>
      </ul>
