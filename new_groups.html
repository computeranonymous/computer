<h1>Starting a Group</h1>

<p>Starting local groups is excellent and highly encouraged, but in order to maintain the integrity of the groups, there are a few things you should keep in mind.</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Location matters!</strong>
        <ol>
            <li>Venues should be chosen with accessibility in mind - be it physical accessibility, financial accessibility, or generally safe places for all people.</li>
            <li>Many groups will likely be meeting in pubs and bars, but this certainly isn't mandatory and might not even be desired. It's worth exploring alternatives.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Consult the group about best times</strong>
        <ol>
            <li>Finding a good time for <em>everyone</em> is difficult, if not impossible, but you should make an attempt to use tools like <a href="http://doodle.com/">doodle</a> to find times that work best.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Be mindful of tool barriers</strong>
        <ol>
            <li>Git and IRC are great tools for collaboration, but not everyone is familiar with them. We want to include and encourage participation from people with all backgrounds, so knowledge of these systems shouldn't be a prerequisite.</li>
            <li>Be available in other mediums so people can get help if they need it.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Address problems when they arise</strong>
        <ol>
            <li>Remember, everyones safety is a top priority. In order for these groups to survive, people need to be held accountable. Someone should be available to handle problems within the group.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
</ul>
