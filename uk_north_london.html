<h2>Current Status</h2>

London group</a> for ongoing meetups.</p>

<h2>The Meetings</h2>

<p>The organisers are looking to create a non-drinking relaxed North London event as an alternative to the typical "meet in a pub, don't drink if you don't want to" event. We recommend people bring craft projects, instruments, or anything else people might enjoy.</p>
