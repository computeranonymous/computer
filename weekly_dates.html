      <h1>The best dates to computer</h1>
     
      <h2>Problem?</h2> 
      <p>
        Different people can make different days. If we say "There will always be some 
        people who can't make it, just pick a day" we exclude specifically the people 
        who can't make that day, and it will usually be the same people over and over
        again. 
      </p>
      <p>
        This is sad. We like including people and want to do more of it, so we want to
        find days of the week where everyone can attend.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unfortunately this is literally impossible. There are no days where everyone can
        make it.
      </p>
      
      <h2>Solution!</h2>
      <p>
        We seem to have quite a gathering of people interested in going to a pub in inclusive
        manner: Enough that on any given day we pick we're likely to be able to gather
        enough people for a meetup that we won't be sitting in the pub on our own feeling
        sorry for ourself.
      </p>

      <p>
        I propose we have weekly meetups. Once enough time has passed, we can figure out
        which of those days work best. These can then be designated "main" computer days. 
        If people like the weekly meetups these can continue, otherwise we can just start
        meeting up on only those main days.
      </p>

      <h3>Algorithm :(</h3>

      <p>
        I initially suggested this algorithm as a joke, but it's actually got a lot of nice
        properties and I think we should use it.
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li> We always meet on the first Thursday of every month</li>
        <li>
          If this week does not contain the first Thursday of the month, we meet on the
          previous day of the week to last week
        </li>
        <li>
          If last week's meetup was on a Monday then we meet on Friday (this will happen
          only very rarely)
        </li>
      </ol>

      This has the following desirable properties:

      <ul>
        <li>
          It conveniently coincides with the two best days in the doodle for the first 
          computer meetup.
        </li>
        <li>
          It gives all days of the week other than Friday an equal hearing.
        </li>
        <li>
          It never clashes with Pub Standards.
        </li>
        <li>
          It mostly avoids Friday, because we're worried that Friday meetups will be a 
          bit too heavy on the drinking, but every now and then when the stars align it
          gives us a computer party.
        </li>
      </ul> 

      <h4>Computer</h4>

      <p>
        Here's a handy Javascript implementation which will tell you this and next week's
        meet-up days.
      </p>
        

      <noscript>
      <p>
      Unfortunately there's no server side scripting on Github pages so we had to do this in
      Javascript. :(
      </p>
      <p>
      If you can't run Javascript we're really sorry. Please use the algorithm description
      above or ask someone on IRC.
      </p>

      </script>

      <h3>What do?</h3>
      
      <p>
        Basically I think we should run with these dates for a few months. Any days which
        are just obviously dead (e.g. we might not get much traction on Monday) we can mark
        as such and stop trying to go to.
      </p>

      <p>
        Each week we should pick a pub for that week (suggested algorithm: "Anyone object to 
        same one as last week?" with some sort of voting if answer is yes) and gather there
        on the prescribed day. Computer should ensue.
      </p>

      <p>
        After two months we should mark the two days in the Month with the most diverse turnout
        (for the sake of explicitness lets say the function we're optimising for is "number of
        people who are not white cis men who turn up") as the official main computer days. If 
        people want to keep doing things on the rest, that's cool too, but the main ones should
        be the ones we encourage people to turn up to.
