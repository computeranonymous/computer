    The Meetings
</h2>
<p>
    At the moment we're investigating to see how much interest there is for a Meeting in Cardiff. Once we hit a critical mass (5 is good, right?) we'll start looking into dates that work for all. If you're interested in coming, either fork <a href="https://github.com/computeranonymous/computer">the repository</a>, tweet me at <a href="https://twitter.com/sgsabbage">@sgsabbage</a>, email me at: my twitter handle AT gmail DOT com, or find me on the ##computer or ##computer.cardiff IRC channels on Freenode.

<h2 id="venues">Potential Venues</h2>

<p>
    <a href="http://www.urbantaphouse.co.uk/">Urban Tap House</a> - I've heard nothing but praise for this place, though I don't know what it's like for groups to meet up.
</p>

<p>
    <a href="http://www.milgilounge.com/">Milgi</a> - It has a yurt! Also, a lovely environment, heated garden, hot drinks, vegetarian and vegan food.
</p>

<p>
    A Shot In The Dark - Well-known independent coffee house on City Road. Again, very nice atmosphere, free wifi, large upstairs with comfortable sofas.
</p>

<p>
   I've just added a few to get us started, but if you have any favoured venues that aren't on this list, let me know, or fork the repo and add them!
